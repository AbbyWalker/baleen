			<h1>Ordering of Annotators</h1>
			<p>The Baleen REST API will provide you with a list of all available annotators, but it provides them in alphabetical order.
			This isn't the best order to have them in however, and in some cases may even cause some annotators to fail.
			Here we'll discuss working out the order they should be done in.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="container">
		<p>The majority of annotators can run anywhere in the pipeline without any issues - this includes the majority of Regular Expression (RegEx) annotators.
		However, some annotators are dependent on the outputs of other annotators, and therefore must follow these annotators in the processing chain.
		Below is some general guidance to help you decide on an appropriate order for your purposes.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The Language OpenNLP annotator (language.OpenNLP) should generally come first in the pipeline, as a number of other annotators are dependent on it.</li>
			<li>Cleaners should generally come at the end of the pipeline, as there's no point cleaning up until we've done everything else!</li>
			<li>In general, the more generic a cleaner or annotator, the later it should come in the pipeline so that specific cases have already been dealt with.
			For example, cleaners.RemoveNestedEntities should come after cleaners.RemoveDateTimes and cleaners.RemoveLocations.</li>
			<li>Grammatical annotators are usually best placed after most of the other annotators, as they often rely on existing annotations as well as the grammatical information.</li>
			<li>Coreference cleaners are usually best placed after most of the other cleaners, so that they have the 'best' annotations to work with when trying to find coreferences.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The advice above is just general guidance, and there will be exceptions to most rules.
		To properly 'optimise' your pipeline, you should read the Javadoc for the annotators you are using to understand how they work
		and therefore the potential dependencies between annotators.</p>
