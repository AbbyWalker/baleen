			<h1>Developing Shared resources</h1>
			<p>SharedResources are instance which are accessible across a
				pipeline. These can be used to implement shared state (such as with
				history), sharing complex or memory intensive data structures (such
				as gazetteers), or sharing access to remote resources.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="container">
		<p>Shared resources are simply a class derived from BaleenResource
			(which in turn derived from Resource_ImplBase). At a basic level
			implementors should subclass BaleenResource and then add the methods
			required for that resource.</p>

		<p>Resources will typically fall into two categories.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Those which hold and manage an item such as a gazetteer or
				database connection. In which case the SharedResource is likely to
				have functions such as as get() and effectively acts as a 'pipeline
				singleton'.</li>
			<li>Those which offer common functionality, allowing plugin
				implementation to be offered pipeline elements. Implementations are
				likely to have more functional methods (categorise(document) or
				translate(text)).).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>As each pipeline is single threaded and processes only a single
			document, shared resources need not be thread safe. However
			implementations may need to make requests of other services (eg
			database or remote web services) which are synchronous / slow and
			they may also cache data. This can lead to unintended side effects.</p>

		<p>Through BaleenResource shared resources have very basic
			lifecycle:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>doInitialize: call to create the resource and initialise it.</li>
			<li>afterResourcesInitialized: called after all other resources
				have been initialised.</li>
			<li>doDestroy: called when the resource is no longer required to
				clean up, free memory, etc.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The important point from the lifecycle is applicable to resources
			which themselves depend on other resources (ie inject other shared
			resources). An example is a gazetteer which depends on a shared
			database resources to provide it's terms. When the gazetteer
			doInitialise is called the database shared resource may not yet be
			initialised and may not be injected as a Uimafit dependency (that is
			<code>@ExternalResource private Database sharedDb;</code>
			will be null).
		</p>
		<p>Behind the scenes, Uimafit will first doInitialize all
			resources then inject resources into one another (and annotators
			etc). If your initialisation requires access to other resources you
			should perform that initialisation in afterResourcesInitialized (and
			not doInitialise).</p>
		<h2>Using shared resources</h2>
		<p>
			Use of shared resources is given in <a
				href="developing_annotators_with_resources.html">Developing
				annotators with resources</a>. The same approach can be used with
			consumers, collection readers and indeed other resources
		</p>
		<p>Resources are configured from the global and pipeline
			configuration (the pipeline overrides the global configuration as usual).</p>
