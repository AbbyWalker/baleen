			<h1>Adding a new database</h1>
			<p>External databases are used extensively in Baleen; to load
				documents from for processing (in collection readers), to load
				processing information from (e.g. gazetteers in annotator) or to
				save data to (in consumers). They can also be used for support
				services such as logging, history and metrics. Deployers of Baleen
				will typically want to use their preferred database.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="container">
		<p>Baleen has inbuilt with database support for Mongo,
			Elasticsearch and an inmemory option (largely designed for
			testing).</p>
		<p>
			Additional databases are implemented as BaleenResources. As a shared
			resources they are available throughout a pipeline which offers
			implementators options for connection pooling and resource management
			to avoid overloading remote database servers. See <a
				href="developing_sharedresources.html">Developing
				SharedResources</a> for further information.
		</p>
		<p>A typical pattern for implementing a database as a
			BaleenResource will be form a database connection in doInitialize()
			and close that connection in doDestroy.</p>

		<h3>Specific uses of database in Baleen</h3>
		<p>We now consider how to implement resources in the different use
			cases. In each case the database should be injected into the pipeline
			as a BaleenResource.</p>
		<p>In all cases thought should be given to storage and query
			patterns, and appropriate indices created on the database to maintain
			pipeline throughput.</p>
		<p>Implementors should avoid hard coding any configuration into a
			databases.</p>
		<h4>Collection reader</h4>
		<p>Extending BaleenCollectionReader, the database should be polled
			in doHasNext. If new data exists to process, it should be stored in
			the instance and the corresponding item marked as 'in processing' (or
			even deleted) from the database. This supports clustering (multiple
			version of Baleen polling the same database) to avoid two instance of
			Baleen processing the same data item. This 'get and change' should be
			performed within a single transaction (if transactions exist in the
			database).</p>
		<p>The retrieved item (that is temporarily stored in the instance)
			should be processed and returned through doGetNext.</p>
		<h4>Annotators</h4>
		<p>Use of a database in an annotator will be very dependent on
			that annotator. Thought should be given to whether to cache the
			database's content in memory to avoid querying the database for each
			document. If data is cached then it should be periodically refreshed
			(or ideally refreshed on change).</p>
		<h4>Consumers</h4>
		<p>Consumers will write the results of the pipeline (a Uima JCas
			object) into the database.</p>
		<p>What they store and the format they store should match the
			business requirements for onward processing of data.</p>
		<p>Thought should be given to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Insert new or replace existing documents with the same
				external id</li>
			<li>Storage of history information</li>
			<li>If the data should be verified/acknowledge on writer (called
				the write concern / consistency) to maintain integrirty at the cost
				of performance</li>
			<li>Batching of data (for fast and high volume pipelines)</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>History</h4>
		<p>History implementations should implement DocumentHistory and
			BaleenHistory.</p>
		<p>For a typical database AbstractBaleenHistory and
			AbstractBaleenDocumentHistory provides a start point for
			implementation, with AbstractCachingBaleenHistory offering the
			desirable aspect of managing a local in-memory cache while a document
			is being processed through the pipeline.</p>
		<p>Where possible database changes should be saved live (that is
			saved to the database as they happen). This will not only reduce the
			amount of state in memory but also allow better diagnosis of errors.</p>
		<p>Any functions which get items from the database (getHistory on
			DocumentHistory) should be made performant and get a minimal data.</p>
